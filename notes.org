#+TITLE: Design notes

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_system#Category_theoretic_formalization

* Naive sketch of experimental implementation
- An action is the (application of) a *pure*, total function =a: state -> state option=
- Brute force:
  + apply each action
    - if =Some s'=, then we transition
    - if =None=, then we try the next action
    - if no actions apply, we have reached a deadlock (or termination)
  + if we have seen a state before, we back track to previous branches
- Property:
  + An invariant is a function =inv: state * state -> bool=
  + For each pair of states =s= and =s'= we apply =inv s s'=. When false, our
    property has been violated.
- Symbolic:
  - Since the functions are total, we can compute their extension, and encode
    that as SMT constraints?
- Look at "Dealing with Functional Programs as Data" in "Programming in
  Higher-order Logic".
- Sub-state transitions can be defined simply as functions that map over
  sub-components of the state, but we'll need a way to give those possibly
  non-deterministic execution.

In (cite:baier08_princ) a state is represented by a "set of atomic
propositions" (20). So couldn't the transition system just be a derivation,
according to rules that say how to derive some set of propositions from others?

- state :: Set of atomic propositions == conjunction of atomic propositions,
  e.g., =S = a & b & c=
- action :: Linear implication from one conjunction to another =S -o S'=. This makes
  an action a first-order horn clause cite:miller2012programming).
  - Since the change of state usually removal of some atomic facts, the
    implication must be linear.
  - Let's call the set of actions =A=.
- invariant :: A disjunction of propositions on the right of the turnstile.
  - safety :: A proposition on the right of the turnstile: =S, A --> Safe=
  - liveness :: A higher-order  proposition =(S, A --> I) --> Live=

* TODO Critique of the regnant approach to model checking

From a media/techno-critical theoretical perspective, the following assumptions
that seem to be maintained by the prevailing approach to model checking seem
deserving of careful criticism:

- Representationalism :: model vs. reality
  - So it leaves a gulf that invites skepticism
- Atomism :: a state is a set of atomic values
  - By actual being is only its relations of becoming.
  - Being is not a sequence of static states, it is a rhythmic, relational,
    flow, wherein each thing is inexhaustibly differentiable and inextricably
    intertwined with its neighbors.

* TODO Some notes on LTL


Putting aside a general critique or skepticism of modality, I think there is
reason to expect that it is a deeply inadequate way to encode the phenomena of
time into logic.

The atomistic assumptions of the way time, and "state" gets represented is
deeply problematic. It inherits the problems inherent to the modern
theorization, and treats time in a way that is quite regressive. Not only does
is it inadequate to the phenomenological reality of time (and logic must above
all be adequate to what is given in phenomenological "self-evidence"), it is not
even up to date with relativistic insights. The treatment of time Newtonian.

My hypothesis is that a "proper" encoding of time should treat objects as purely
relational, and time as the continuously evolving deformations and interactions
of the relationality. And

In conversation with [[https://boarders.github.io/][Callan McGill]]:

Callan:

#+begin_quote
in a distributed setting time is very up for grabs
#+end_quote

Me:

#+end_quote
Yes! The whole assumption that there is a universal clock goes out the window in
a distsys But the assumption that we can slice up times into discrete moment
chunks is the assumption of universal clock!
#+begin_quote

Callan:

#+begin_quote
it is a sort of double assumption I would say
the assumption of a universal clock in that:
1. we all have a shared starting point
2. We all have reference to the evolution of time intervals from that starting point
#+end_quote

Me:

#+begin_quote
yeah, exactly.

And then there's also the assumption that the way change happens is by
discontinuous replacement of values/atomic propositions.
